# I'm Zoheb Sharif

I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Science student at CSU East Bay (Dean's Honor List), with a passion for building tech that informs, empowers, and connects people. From designing data visualizations at Berkeley Lab to crafting intelligent AI study tools and Pokémon agents, I love tackling ambitious ideas with thoughtful design and scalable code.
